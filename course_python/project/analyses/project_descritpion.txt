Hello there,

I'll give you a warm up exercise and the first part of the actual data 
set containing person's sleep data. This is collected from some Samsung 
Health app.

You need to start  byexploring, understanding and cleaning the data 
first. Then continue analyzing it and making interesting discoveries and 
conclusions.

It is in the attached jupyter notebook.

In addition to the sleep data I gave you already (and yes, work with the 
same data file), here are the extra files:

     - Heart rate:

     - Step Count:

     - Floors climbed:

     A few points:

         - Try to investigate each data set individually first. Dig into 
each of them as much as you can.

         - When happy with individual analysis, try to connect the data 
sets. Go simple first. say, create a date key and include the aggregated 
value for some of the quantities. For example, total steps per day, 
total floors climbed per day etc.

          - Then try to create a more granular key that allows you to 
look at the events with more accuracy.

        - As I said, there is not one unique way of doing this. What I'd 
like to see is your (painful) journey of investigation and discovery !

     - You can use whatever library you like. "seaborn" is a useful 
plotting library : https://seaborn.pydata.org/

Have fun !
