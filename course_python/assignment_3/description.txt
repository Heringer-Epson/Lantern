Description in verbatim of the assignment.

Create a jupyter notebook named "Session_3_assignment_<your name>.ipynb" and perform the following. Separate each part with a Markdown comment as we did in the class. Send your file to me by email before next class.  


- Do "Sorting a List Into Buckets" from "Making Choices" page
- Do "Fixing and Testing" from "Defensive Programming" page
- Search for "You do the rest" in  "Command-Line Programs" page and complete the code


- Two friends want to find a lunch spot and both of them have a list of favorite places ordered by decreasing preference. They agree that they will select
    	the restaurant with the least combined rank in the 2 lists.

    	Example:

    	Input:'

        	restaurants_1: [â€˜El Farolito', 'Japa Curry', 'Eatsa']

        	restaurants_2: ['Japa Curry', 'Eatsa', 'Ayola', 'Working Girls']

    	Output:

        	'Japa Curry'. Because it has the least combined rank  of 3

        	(2 in restaurants_1 and 1 in restaurants_2).

   	 

	The selected restaurant should be in both the lists.The input provided will not have 2 restaurants with the same rank. So you don't have to factor that in.


    	Friends will eat at 'yummy' if they can't reach a consensus.

    	Input:

        	restaurants_1: ['El Farolito', 'Japa Curry']

        	restaurants_2: ['Ayola', 'Working Girls']

    	Output: 

        	'yummy'


	Note you might want to search how to get the index of an element in a list !




- The greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is the largest number that divides both of them with no remainder.

	One way to find the GCD of two numbers is based on the observation that if r is the remainder when a is divided by b, then gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r). As a base case, we can use gcd(a, 0) = a.

	Write a function called gcd that takes parameters a and b and returns their greatest common divisor.


- The Koch curve is a kind of a fractal (google it to see what it is ). To draw a p; with length x, all you have to do is

	Draw a Koch curve with length x/3.

	Turn left 60 degrees.

	Draw a Koch curve with length x/3.

	Turn right 120 degrees.

	Draw a Koch curve with length x/3.

	Turn left 60 degrees.

	Draw a Koch curve with length x/3.


	The exception is if x is less than 3: in that case, you can just draw a straight line with length x.
