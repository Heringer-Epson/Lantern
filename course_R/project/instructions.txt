1) Download USD and CAD LIBOR data for multiple tenors from FRED’s web site

2) Check data for gaps, sudden jumps and other data quality issues

3) Plot time series of interbank rates (IRs) and their 1-day and 25-day increments using either xtspackage

4) Plot histogram of IRs and their 1-day and 25-day increments, and fit several distributions
to the histrograms. Which distributions does provide the best fit?

5) Calculate and plot average term structure of LIBOR and its standard deviation.

6) What is the relationship between standard deviation of the 1-day and 25-day IR increments?
How does it depend on the increment time periods, i.e. 1-day and 25-days?
Does this relationship depend on the increment tenor?

7) Using corrplotpackage plot correlation matrix between various tenors of LIBOR 1-day
and 25-day increments. What is the difference between correlation matrices for USD and CAD?

8) Calculate and plot three first principal components of IR 1-day and 25-day increments.
How much total variance do they explain?

9) Using sdepackage fit Vasicektype model to each tenor of USD and CAD LIBOR.

10) Combine the fitted Vasicekmodels by using correlated Brownian motions simulated using
the first three principal components. Leverage Jamshidianand Zhu (1997) approach.
